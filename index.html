    <h1>Vito Acconci Invites You to Watch Him as He Watches Us</h1>
    <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/01/arts/01ACCONCI/01ACCONCI-master768.jpg"
    <p>Vito Acconci, who bushwhacked the path to video art in New York 
    in the 1960s and early 1970s, makes many of today’s young artists look tame.
    The nearly 60 short videos in “Vito Acconci: Where We Are Now 
    (Who Are We Anyway?), 1976,” the excellent early-career survey at MoMA PS1,
    manage to be unnervingly funny, pathetically gross and politically 
    razor-sharp. And even with a decades-old patina of age, 
    they’re still too funky to fit into MoMA’s scrubbed white Manhattan premises.
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Acconci appears in all of them. Thirty-something, hirsute, 
    in slack shape, he looks and acts the part of sleazoid voyeur, 
    stand-up comic, psychopath and self-martyred saint. He’s silent in the early
    films, and compulsively verbal in several of the later ones, often engaged
    in wheedling, threatening or accusing an invisible lover, or himself, or us.
    </p>
    <p>Art historians have pointed to narcissism as the fuel for his early work,
    but Mr. Acconci was not in the business of inventing the video equivalent of 
    selfies. In ways not so different from Cindy Sherman’s in photography, 
    he was creating multiple characters who happened to share a body — his — 
    that he wanted both to explore and escape, and that was coming apart
    under stress.</p>
